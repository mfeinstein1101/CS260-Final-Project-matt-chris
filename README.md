Matt and Chris

### Matt and Chris: 12-02-24 (2 hours)
- Found 3 varying data sets
- Discussion of how to apply each, what algorithms to use (Information Gain)

### Matt and Chris: 12-03-24 (1 hour)
- Collected another data set
- Began algorithm development, thefts_by_month.ipynb

### Matt 12-04-24 (1 hour)
- Built a webscraper 
- Constructed new and most useful data set (Car Theft Data)

### Matt and Chris 12-04-24 through 12-20-24 (~25-30 hours)
- Naive Bayes algorithm for Car Theft Data (Around 80% accuracy)
- Information Gain for Car Theft Data (make/model best feature)
- Linear Regression algorithm on the car dataset
- OpenAI API used to prompt and generate more features for Car Theft Data (Unusable without API key)
- Logistic Regression algorithm on Car Theft Data (around 65% accuracy, not great)
- Histogram program to visualize rate of theft distribution
